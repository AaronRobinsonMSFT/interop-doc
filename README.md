# .NET Interop Document Respository

This repository is inspired by [mem-doc](https://github.com/Maoni0/mem-doc). Its purpose is to provide insight and guidance on how to be successful when interoperating between .NET and another virtual machine or non-managed language (for example, C/C++). This repository is living so is by definition "incomplete". Contributions are welcome.

**Disclaimer**: Details in this repository are based on the author's experience. Information contained within should not be taken as official Microsoft or .NET recommendations/guidance. For official documentation see below.
